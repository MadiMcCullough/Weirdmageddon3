# Weirdmageddon3
A Gravity Fall Themed Space Invader- type game where the player can shoot Bill Cipher with Nyan Cat. 

## Description
This code will create a game that resembles a shoot 'em up video game like *Space Invaders*. *Space Invaders* from 1978 was an impactful game that bolstered the action game genre, and remains memorable to today. 

The theme is centered around Disney's show *Gravity Falls* by Alex Hirsch. The show was very impactful for the children that grew up watching it and has inspired many artists to pursue a career in animation.
